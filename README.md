## About this course

The course covers fundamentals of R, a high-level programming language, and use it to wrangle data for analysis and visualization. The programming skills you will learn are transferable to learn more about R independently and other high-level languages such as Python. At the end of the class, you will be reproducing analysis from a scientific publication!

## Learning Objectives

After taking this course, you will be able to:

-   **Analyze** Tidy datasets in the R programming language via data wrangling, summary statistics, and visualization.

-   **Compute** summary statistics and create data visualizations to interpret data.

-   **Describe** how the R programming environment interpret complex expressions made out of functions, operations, and data structures, in a step-by-step way.

-   **Apply** problem solving strategies to debug broken code.
